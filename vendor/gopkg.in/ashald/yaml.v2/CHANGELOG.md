## 2.4.0 - 2019-05-25

### Added

- Restricted maps key type from `interface{}` to `string`.
  Considered a minor rather than major as it's more restricting.
  Kudos to [@jveski](https://github.com/jveski) for his [fix](https://github.com/Navops/yaml/commit/85482c8b225b4cb87bcb8532d2bf81b72b2f4c3c).


## 2.3.0 - 2018-06-19

### Added
